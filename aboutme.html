            <p class="Paragraph">My name is Vignesh Mohan, and I am an engineer by qualification. A gamer, traveller and a foodie by passion. 
            My passion for travel especially around nature like hiking etc mainly originates from the peace I get from being in that environment.
            Everyday life with work just fades away that peaceful moment that you need with yourself and appreciate everything around you with the right people.
            I personally everyday life gets hectic and we just need that pause moment. I use weekends for a getaway and have a personal goal to see the whole world.
            I have always had a passion for coding especially in previous jobs I used VBA and html for making certain code in excel which would produce particular 
            results based on inputs.
